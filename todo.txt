* ensure typevars in invoke are unique to the scope before adding

* make a temporary function to go through all variables and resolve their types, and report if they resolve further, which might be an issue...

* remove unused typechecking vars somehow...
* clean up typechecking code
* implement type definition in namebinding and typechecking
* should you allow keyword arguments in invoke; foo(a=10, b=20)
* should you allow arguments with a default value to be omitted from a function call?, that would require a bunch of changes to typechecking


* add dicts syntax

* issue with separator/lf not working when two expressions are on the same line (it should produce a parse error)
* add line and column numbers to error reporting
* add error returning so multiple errors can be caught at once
* make nestable comments

* add macros and expandable forms (like lisp)
