* you might have to eventually unify class and concrete, because parse_type() can not distinguish between the two
* there needs to be a way to cast pointers down when calling parent class methods
* llvm doesn't optimize method calls, such that the object is resolved twice...

* add function and method overloading
* add a 'tag' field to Function, along with a base name arg to bind_names and use look-ahead to change the names of functions, taking
  into account classes and maybe nested functions...

* should class bodies have different rules; i've already had to make it treat definitions specially, but i could just have the parser
  create a different ast element for class body definitions... maybe the same form even, using let, or maybe with a different keyword, like def
* there needs to be a constructor function that is automatically added? or at least required during name binding

* fix scope resolution to also work on objects, so that you can have static methods...
* make structdef Rc<Vec<(String, Type)>> so you can make multiple references to the same one without cloning

* how are you going to do strings, with allocation? (have I got this, other than GC?)



* implement garbage collection
* error when type checking calls to methods; and with passing/type checking the first argument (the object itself)
* general issues with the type checker and the proliferation of type variables

* should classes be values, added to the name space, or should they only be defined as types; should types be first class or not?

* how will modules and importing work?

* add error returns instead of panics
* get llvm closures working
* change the debug prints to overwrite Debug formatting for scopes


TYPE CHECKING:

* ensure typevars in invoke are unique to the scope before adding
* remove unused typechecking vars somehow...
* clean up typechecking code
* implement type definition in namebinding and typechecking
* should you allow keyword arguments in invoke; foo(a=10, b=20)
* should you allow arguments with a default value to be omitted from a function call?, that would require a bunch of changes to typechecking

* handling of class methods "self" type is kind of a hack
* make a temporary function to go through all variables and resolve their types, and report if they resolve further, which might be an issue...


PARSER:

* issue with separator/lf not working when two expressions are on the same line (it should produce a parse error)
* add line and column numbers to error reporting
* add error returning so multiple errors can be caught at once
* make nestable comments

FEATURES:

* add dicts syntax
* add macros and expandable forms (like lisp)
* what about type functions to build/cast to specific C/LLVM types, like i32, i8, etc
