* strings might have issues because of their irregularity
* fix buffer builtin class, or circumvent somehow 
* convert invoke to add the object arg (it's actually not needed, but the AST is duplicated)
* also support the __alloc__ thing, which is needed by some
* how do you get the function to compare values? (for match)

* implement match
* implement sideeffect
* implement resolve properly
* implement loops (for, while)
* implement try, raise
* implement modules

* figure out a better way of doing variables/generics
* implement return value conversion

* should vtables be dynamically allocated, or should we add a LLType::ElementOf() type or something to GetElement an aliased type
* try to reuse as much code in transform as possible
* should you implement strings differently?
* refactor access transform



BUGS:
* if there are brackets after a record literal, it will try to call it as a function: let bar = ref { a = 1, b = 2 } \n (!x).a    parses incorrectly,
  but adding a semi-colon will fix it
* prefix operations should bind closer than subatomic_operations: !x.a should be parsed as (!x).a but instead is !(x.a)
* there is still a bug with the Phi statement, in that it will return null if you don't cover all cases. there is no check for coverage


TESTS:
* make test for function pointers, assign to local, call as ref
* test for match, if, sideeffects
* test for references, records, tuples, used in local vars, func args, return values, etc


* remove AST::Recall when you switch over to llvm2
* remove builtin stuff that's usused

* make an "as" for of decl, like decl buffer_resize as resize: () -> ??
* implement assignment of tuples and records?
* there's probably an issue with records in that we might not take into account different orders of items... { a=1, b=2 } might not equal { b=2, a=1 }
* there is no way to assign to a ref

* I think it should be doable to make all functions including methods be closures, especially if you put the context at the end
* we need to make molten code and transform in order to convert nested closures. We at least need to transform the record constructor to convert the idents
let context = ref { var1 = ident1, var2 = ident2 }
return (func, context)
* it makes more sense, if you go for abi specifiers, to make methods use one instead of closures.

* should you unify some aspects of references and objects?  at least the codegen stuff, rather than duplicating some code
* modify resolve to return a result rather than unwrapping


* you can put a restriction on type aliases such that a type can only use type vars defined in the declaration
* you could require that classes explicitly define their type variables by name, to catch type errors.  So every method or definition in the top level of the class
  could only use explicitly declared type variables

* the current problem with closure code (line 269 of test.ml) is that we're assigning a closure to a struct field but the types don't match, because the get_type function
  returned an actual function type, rather than a pointer to the closure context... so you kinda need a way to distinguish different function types


* there was a problem with generics when using tuple pair closures, because a tuple pair was too big to coerce into an i8*. You can convert back when generics
  are fixed to adjust to their size

* there are poor error messages when deleting the "=" from a "let something = fn x => ..." both inside and outside classes.... shouldn't be doing this (actually, because of
  let without init, and the lf issue... lf fix would solve this)
* there was an error where "let ni: newint" with no initializer was causing a type error with "expected class or concrete type", but that was actually because a definition without
  an initializer is the same as "let ni: newint = nil" and nil could not be cast to a Record, which newint is a typealias of a record
* either add in the initialization of class variables, possibly limited to constant expressions only, or else raise an error if an initializer is provided
* there must be a way to fix the 'scope exceptions' (Scope::target) that we're doing to make class bodies work... pass in an argument to all scoped functions?  or use scopemap and scope ids?

* you might not be making sure that non-closure functions don't access variables outside their scope (methods are never closures)
* make sure that you don't overload different types of functions (closures, functions, and methods must all be the same type to allow overloading)
* should you make mutable modifiers more strict, like rust?


* improve storing of file info in the Pos structs (maybe rename to Span?)
* change parser to take session argument or something so it can record the file info, and maybe do other advanced things
* should you add session to refinery and process imports there
* one thing i'm seeing a lot of now is stuff like classspec.ident.name... can we prevent so many levels deep?
* do you need a BuiltinDef type? a GlobalVarDef type?
* add the .set_id() functions to simpliy ast builders

* should we factor out some of the code in codegen which builds vtables into transform or classdef, such that you can build the type from either??
* get rid of unwind argument, and put it in an object

* it might also make it easier/generic to allow compiling to object files?  So no linking, but it would do optimization and object file output
* how does rust do "use" if there is a circular dependency?
* put intermediate files somewhere else, at least as controlled by the molten script, so as not to clutter source directories

* there's still a problem with typevars not resolving fully, where a function that should return a concrete returns a free typevar.... (recursion or forward definition)


* implement enums
* add patterns and matching of patterns
* add a spread operator for records
* add an iterator type
* get llvm closures working
* implement exceptions
* implement garbage collection
* add compiler directives?
* use customized visitors throughout

* issue with separator/lf not working when two expressions are on the same line (it should produce a parse error)
* better support for generics; right now it just forces everything to/from a pointer type
* fill in string and list type functions, and finish hashmap (rename to dict?)




* should you make the top level module functions be closures, instead of using global vars
* if even the global/module scope was a closure, then you could make a module be equivallent to an implicit function that is called when the module is imported, which could have the name of the
  module; so a module called main would become the main() function


* should exports also list all the modules that the file imports, so that class definitions in other imports can be found, if needed for arguments
* should you add access modifiers to classes, and maybe functions; public, private, protected
* should you fix scope resolution to also work on objects, so that you can have static methods from the object without explicitly referencing its type
* should you remove the Nil type?
* should you add break/continue statements for loops
* should you add a return statement?  It's not functional, but it's practial
* should you change Real to Float?  also should you change them to lower case names, which is in line with sml, ocmal, f#
* should you allow keyword arguments in invoke; foo(a=10, b=20)
* should you allow arguments with a default value to be omitted from a function call?, that would require a bunch of changes to typechecking
* should local variables be allowed to be mutable...
* should you require an override keyword when masking definitions in lower scopes? like class definitions
* should you add macros and expandable forms (like lisp)

* is it even possible to add a special "constrained" type, which has &AST that must type check correctly in order to match (checks done in check_type)
* you might need to integrate type restrictions which have to get resolved later; like 'a where 'a is object with add(Int) method; not sure how you could be so specific without complexity
* what if you generalize overloaded types, such that they're checked in check_type, and options are eliminated, or resolved to one type over the course of checking
* if you make ops methods, then everything has to be type annotated, with the type system as it is; you'd need constrained types, or multiple paths, or bidirectional or something
  make typed functions for all math operations, with the inlinealways attribute, if you decide to make operators methods
* what if you have a 'context' passed to the node visitors that would allow "if" to know if its' return is used or not, and so whether typechecking must match



EXAMPLE PROGRAM IDEAS:

* hash table
* regex matcher
